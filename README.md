# NgSudoku - Angular Sudoku Board

This project is my first exercise in Angular development.

For now it is a simple Sudoku Board, with input Validator, cannot start a new game yet, cannot check if it is allready finished.

# Opinions and suggestions.

If you would like to suggest any new features or ideas for this project, don't hassitate to let me know

Code review is welcome also.
